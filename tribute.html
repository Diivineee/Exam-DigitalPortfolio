        <p>Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. 
            Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century.

            <p><br>
                "Michael Jackson's Death is still as much of a shock to everyone else but it feels like he's still here with us. 
                His music touched us all in many different ways as there is many different songs that he sung. 
                Michael was good to us even though I never saw any of his concerts in person. 
                But besides that if I had to take sides on which musical artists is the best, Michael Jackson is always the answer. 
                Michael Jackson may of been shy one moment then really brave and estatic another - he was an icon to everyone, even if others didn't like him!!. 
                Michael We Miss You Sooo Much.""
